# 1:1 Meetings
1:1 meetings should be beneficial both to the Steward and to the Report while being, usually, 15 minutes or less in duration via video call, and 15 minutes or less in preparation or follow-up work.

Prior to the 1:1, the Report should take 15 minutes or less and:
- Compile what they’ve accomplished since the last one-on-one
- Compile any obstacles they’ve run into and prepare to discuss at the one-on-one

During the 1:1, the Report should:
- Listen more than speak, and have their video on to portray positive body language and undivided attention
- At the end of the meetings, recap action items and make clear who is expected to do what and by when.

During the 1:1, both Steward and Report should:
- Assume the best of intentions of the other
- Take detailed notes and record action items. “Awkward” silences are ok!

After the 1:1, the Steward should take 15 minutes or less and:
- Report any obstacles out of their control to their Superior Steward.
- Send a message thanking the Report for their time and that they’ve sent their requests up the chain, if relevant.
