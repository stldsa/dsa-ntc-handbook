# Mission Statement


‚öíÔ∏è serve the common good of the organization.
First and foremost the national tech committee is a committee which serves others. While it is impossible to operate in any space void of political or policy convictions, the National Tech Committee's primary goal is to focus on the brass tacks "building crap" part of things. Our infrastructure must seek to support the chapter's needs rather than impose our ideas of how the organization should run.

üí° foster the skills and knowledge sharing of members.
Socialism is more than just voting for socialists, or attending protests. It's also about mutual aid. Each member of this organization has something to both learn and teach. We are hoping that participation in this committee will give our members energy rather than drain them of energy. We want to empower and encourage people, help them unwrap the black box of technology and to become capable owners of their means of production.

üêù collaborate with other chapters nationally.
Every DSA chapter reserves a certain amount of independence and this is a good thing (especially as the needs of chapters differs based on their members and context), but we also want to cross pollinate!

üåé contribute to the worldwide open source community
Open source is not purely socialistic but it is greatly aligned with our goals. In building our own projects we should seek to share our knowledge and skills with the rest of the open source community. This is itself a form of activism which can help change people's worldviews.

üìá join forces with like minded organizations.
There are many organizations out there with similarly aligned interests. Besides the open source community there are civic organizations, non-profits, artist collectives, and co-ops. By opening our projects to the public, we make them available for organizations that otherwise might not have the technical manpower to accomplish good goals.
