## Steward expectations and SOPs
Stewards at all levels and regardless of department or commission are expected to:
Have one-on-one meetings with their subordinates at least every other week.
This includes both stewards and non-stewards.
Refer to this section regarding successful one-on-ones.
Message #mobilization-requests when there is an opening in their department or commission, and alert the channel as openings are filled, ensuring receipt among a mobilizer.
