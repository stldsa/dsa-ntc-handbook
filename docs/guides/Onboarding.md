# Onboarding
After a new member goes through the mobilization process they should get access to the primary tools we work with. :

- [Slack](#slack)
- [Gitlab](#gitlab)

## Slack

Mobilized members should be added with normal permissions. Admin permissions are reserved for staff, the Steering Committee, our National Political Committee Liaison, \[...\]

## Gitlab

Mobilized members should be added to the `dsausa/ntc` group (this group) with the **Developer** role. That access will be reflected in all repositories within this group, as well as any repositories in the wider `dsausa` org that have the `ntc` group added as a member group. For projects not housed within the `ntc` group the project steward of that group should maintain access in a similar fashion. For additional guidance on roles, see below:

* `Guest/Reporter` roles - More appropriate for my external-facing projects, Should be done per project just to keep the overall membership spread small.
* `Developer` - Default access for NTC mobilized members and collaborators who need to contribute to the repository. Should be the default group for projects as well. Developers _can_ edit project Wikis.
* `Maintainer` - NTC Project Stewards, NTC Department and Commission Leaders (Maybe not SC directly, Ian/John's role?), appropriate technical leads where present. Basically this should be seen as formal or informal leadership and has the final say for merging code, along with adding or removing contributors under this project or project group.
* `Owner` - Staff, NTC Leadership. Has power to delete projects. Should be treated with high security.

New members going through onboarding will go through two meetings before being full members:
- A general onboarding meeting that is one hour in length. It will include the history of the NTC and what to expect regardless of your anticipated role. The new memberâ€™s mobilizer will allow access to this.
- A specific onboarding meeting with the Steward that the new member will report to.
